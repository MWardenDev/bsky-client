# Dev Notes – Bluesky Client

Scratchpad for implementation details, tradeoffs, and technical decisions.

---

## Environment

- Primary dev environment:
  - GitHub Codespaces from an Android tablet (Lenovo)
- Browser:
  - Chrome (for Codespaces)
- Tools (planned):
  - React + TypeScript + Vite
  - Bluesky / AT Protocol client library

---

## Phase 0 Notes

- Goal: get the structure and docs in place before any app code.
- Constraint: avoid helper scripts where possible to reinforce manual understanding.
- UX focus: tablet + laptop usage must be first-class, not an afterthought.
