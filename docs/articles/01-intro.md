# Part 1 – Why I’m Building a Better Bluesky Client

## Overview
This article explains why this project exists: the pain points in the official Bluesky experience and the goals for this custom client.

## Problem / Motivation
- The official app behaves like a phone-only client.
- Tablet landscape and laptop usage are poorly supported (or not supported at all).
- I want a client that behaves like a modern app: responsive layouts, usable on tablet and laptop without fighting the UI.

## Goals for This Phase
- Create the repository and documentation structure.
- Define the roadmap and phases.
- Capture the initial motivation while it’s fresh.
- Make the project easy to follow for anyone reading the repo.

## Technical Choices (So Far)
- GitHub repo as the single source of truth.
- Documentation stored directly in `docs/`.
- Articles written in Markdown so they can be:
  - Read on GitHub,
  - Summarized on LinkedIn,
  - Mirrored to a blog later if desired.

## Next Steps
- Set up the development environment in GitHub Codespaces from the tablet.
- Initialize a React + TypeScript app under `app/`.
- Write Part 2 focused on the environment and base app.
